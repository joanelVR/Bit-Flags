# Bit-Flags
##### The purpose of this program is to allow the user to have all the behavior that we want for a bit collecting data structure. This include functions like set_flag, unset_flag, check_flag, etc. This program was made as an opaque object in order to hide the "guts" of the program from the user. As such, an object must be initialized (init_default) and destroyed (flag_destroy).
